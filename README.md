Agsbs Markdown Helper
===================

**This plugin is in a developing state, not stable**

This is a sublime plugin which is used in our working group. Our working group is transcribing study materials
for blind and visual impaired students ([Elvis - german Website](http://elvis.inf.tu-dresden.de)).

After the creation of the Markdown files a customized pandoc converter is used for the transformation to HTML 
([pandoc-website](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)])

## The Plugin
The plugin offered different functions to fulfil our guidelines, add Markdown content and 
helps unknown transcribers to create markdown-files.

Also a validation is possible.
